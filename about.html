		      <p>
		        I was born, grew up and did proper children things. Then I tried to learn 3D modeling and animation with Autodesk 3ds Max on my own [RenderID], in the galleries you can see some examples such as the pyramid of Chichen Itza or image from the Alcázar of Seville, also AfterEffects, video editing … but now I have left them projects and I care more about technology, I have always been a freak with computers, I’ve always liked investigating the topics that are interesting for me. I also used to go skate boarding with my friends in my free time, but like everything, those days are over now.
		        I currently study Computer Engineering, geek by calling, I love technology, Apple products generally [fanboy inside] besides Microsoft, Google … I have the intention to start development for iOS with expectations of publishing something on the App Store sometime this year.
		        Always coming up with new projects.
